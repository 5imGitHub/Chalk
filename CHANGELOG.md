### 1.1.0 - 2021-10-10 - Shining Colors
**WARNING: Due to internal changes - existing drawn marks and chalks from previous version would be removed from world. I'm sorry, hopefully it will never happen again. (But who knows?)** 

Added:
- **Colored Chalks** for all 16 colors
- **Glowing marks**: use **Glowstone Dust** on a mark to make it really bright. It will slightly light up the surroundings too.
